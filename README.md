# Minting-Website
Here's a quick demo of the minting website I created for the University Of Cincinatti and The Prospect Gallery. I built it upon the metaplex software which gave me a boilerplate website, react.js framework, and rust and solidity for smart contracts. I configured metaplex for The Prospect Gallery with the config.json file for the candy machine and the nft configs. Once these items were configured, I created a small java program to create all versions of the prospect pass nfts which I later uploaded to arweave and loaded into the candy machine. Throughout this project I learned about the basiscs of web 3.0, what a smart contract is were and how they worked, decentralized storage systems such as arweave and ipfs, a little bit of React UI and style components. Soft skills are useful too! I gained lots of patience for troubleshooting things ranging from the solana faucet, to CLI issues. Ultimately, I'm quite happy with what I gaiend from the project and how it turned out!
