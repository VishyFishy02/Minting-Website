# Minting-Website
The minting website I created for The Prospect Gallery. I built it upon the metaplex software which gave me a boilerplate website, react.js framework, and rust and solidity for the smart contract. I configured the software for the prospect gallery with the config.json file for the candy machine and the nft configs. Once these items were configured for the prospect gallery, I created a small java program to create all versions of the prospect pass nfts which I would later upload to arweave and load onto the candy machine. Throughout this project I learned about the basiscs of web 3.0, what smart contract is were and how they worked, decentrailized storage systems such as arweave and ipfs, React UI and style components, and of course, lots of patience for troubleshooting things ranging from the solana faucet, to CLI issues. Ultimately, I'm quite happy with what I gaiend from the project and how it turned out!
